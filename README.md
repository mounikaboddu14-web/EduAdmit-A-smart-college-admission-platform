🎓 EduAdmit: A Smart College Admission Platform
📘 Overview

EduAdmit is a lightweight, cross-platform desktop application designed to automate and simplify college admission management. Built using Python, Tkinter, and SQLite3, it enables administrators to efficiently handle student records—adding, updating, searching, and deleting entries through a user-friendly graphical interface.

This project demonstrates practical integration of GUI design, database management, and logical data handling to replace manual admission processes with a digital, eco-friendly, and scalable system.
